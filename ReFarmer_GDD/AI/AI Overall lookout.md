In Refarmer, the enemies is the animals which have been consumed by the curse. This actions done by Predators, and this lead to animals to attack the base of the Refarmer.

Enemies is going to have got 3 modes depending on the wave ***Number*** & ***difficulity***.

Normal waves ==> most of enemies is going to come with their normal forms, and is going to try to attack the only the tower that we are trying to protect.

		Why?

> [!NOTE] Normal Enemies
> Normal enemies is really passive, they are not really affected by the Predators ***Curse & Energy***
> Which in the end, gives them a little bit control on what they are capable of and they just attack the tower.

> [!NOTE] Hurted Enemies
>Animals which is hurted by the Predators, and succussed to run from them. The place of scar, curse from predators into their body, and they are really not in control that much, but at least they tried to survive. Which also means they have at least some sort of control over their body
>They can attack the towers that is protecting the [[Etruvera]] and they can sometimes also deal AOE 

> [!NOTE] Captured Enemies
> The animals which captured by the Predators, they have got no control over their and behavior.
> They attack the PlayerCharacter mainly to force him go unconscious and march the other units to the [[Etruvera]] to destroy it
