When we are going to start the game, we are going to be in a simple and basic boat.
the game is going to show that (We), we need to [[Etruvera]], with a simple but powerful cutscene, where ReFarmer tries to catch the flower in the boat, while bleeding. Player is going to think:
`What is this flower?` or just don't think anything at all 

We are bleeding, damaged and cursed. IN this moment, we are seeing that we are somewhere unknown, and that place is the place actually [[Obsidian]] lives, and he helps us to recover a little bit.

When ReFarmer is going to wake up, we are thinking about obliterating the Predator, cutting them into pieces, then to edges, then to small particle. At this moment moment Obsidian calms us down, and says that ReFarmer needs to remember what he was doing.

ReFarmer remembers his goal and thanks Obsidian, then he leaves to recover.

While recovering, Refarmer senses a lot of magical energy from all over the place.

and he tries to protect Etruvera, and player doesn't know it

### Between waves
Between waves we have got actually plenty of time, the overall factor which is going to affect the time is what we are we doing, we can only visit one map before wave, then when we come back we are going to see enemy wave slowly comes.

### Story Flow
Story flow is going to be given by the Refarmer itself, as the Refarmer cursed, player needs to heal it, and only obsidian can give the things that can heal Refarmer. So at this moments, slowly player is going to learn the real story of this game.

### Defense
In some specific waves enemies are going to drop some essential resources which is needed to trade with obsidian, as we need to heal ourselves. This is the way to heal ourselves

If we want to places towers which can defend our base even more, Player is going to switch maps to find more resources for making such thing.

Some basic resources is also going to spawn when we don't at that direction (basic resources) in main map

### Economy
Economy is really based on the magic crystal from ***Predators | Animals***
The trader in the game is, [[NPC (ReFarmer)]] in [[Grassland (Main)]] and [[Obsidian]] in [[Obsidian Sanctuary]]
